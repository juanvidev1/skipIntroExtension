# Skip intro extension

This is a simple extension to skip series intro on Netflix and Disney+. This extension doesn't require any user information and only wants to get better user experience avoiding that he user phisically clicks the "Skip" button when is starting a series chapter.

## Collabs

Feel free to download this repo and collaborate with this project. Obviusly the idea is to keep it simple and the only rule is that I will check every change request. Also this extension will never gather any user data because it won't be needed at any moment.

Made with love by JuanviDev. Enjoy!
